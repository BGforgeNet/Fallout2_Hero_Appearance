This a collection of additional __player__ character models for Fallout 2 and games based on its engine.

## Installation

* It is included in [killap's Restoration Project](https://github.com/BGforgeNet/Fallout2_Restoration_Project). If you're using it, you **do not need** to download this collection separately.
* But you can also use it with [killap's Unofficial Patch](https://github.com/BGforgeNet/Fallout2_Unofficial_Patch), other modifications or even vanilla game.
  In that case:
    - Ensure that [sfall](https://github.com/phobos2077/sfall) is installed and `EnableHeroAppearanceMod=1` is set in `ddraw.ini`.
    - After that, simply download the [latest release](https://github.com/BGforgeNet/Fallout2_Hero_Appearance/releases/latest) and extract it into game directory.
