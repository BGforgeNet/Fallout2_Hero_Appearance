This a collection of additional _player_ character models for Fallout 2 and games based on its engine.

## Installation

* It is included in [killap's Restoration Project](https://github.com/BGforgeNet/Fallout2_Restoration_Project). If you're using it, you don't need to download this collection separately.
* You can also use it with [killap's Unofficial Patch](https://github.com/BGforgeNet/Fallout2_Unofficial_Patch), other modification or even vanilla game.
  In that case, you will need to ensure that [sfall](https://github.com/phobos2077/sfall) is installed and `EnableHeroAppearanceMod=1` is set in `ddraw.ini`.
  After that, simply download the latest zip and extract it into game directory.
