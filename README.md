# Hero Appearance mod for Fallout 2

This a collection of additional character models for Fallout 2 and games based on its engine.

It is included in [killap's Restoration Project](https://github.com/BGforgeNet/Fallout2_Restoration_Project). If you're using it, you don't need to download this collection separately.

You can also use it with [killap's Unofficial Patch](https://github.com/BGforgeNet/Fallout2_Unofficial_Patch), other modification or even vanilla game.
In that case, you will need to ensure that [sfall](https://github.com/phobos2077/sfall) is installed and `EnableHeroAppearanceMod=1` is set in `ddraw.ini`.
